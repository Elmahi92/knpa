# knpa
A package to study the effects of algorithms with different computional complexity and how to speedup R code.The package contain three different functions for solving what is called the knapsack problem. The knapsack problem is a discrete optimization problem where we have a knapsack that can take a limited weight W and we want to fill this knapsack with a number of items i = 1; :::; n, each with a weight wi and a value vi. The goal is to find the knapsack with the largest value of the elements added to the knapsack.This problem is NP-hard, meaning that it is "at least as hard as the hardest problem in NP" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness). NP is a (fundamental) class of problems for which there are (currently) no polynomial time algorithms to solve them. It is an open (Millennium Prize) problem, whether it is or is not possible to solve these problemsin polynomial time.
